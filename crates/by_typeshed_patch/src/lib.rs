//! ast patches applied to the basedpython typeshed (`.byi`) after fresh
//! reverse-transpile from upstream `.pyi`
//!
//! each patch declares a set of target symbols and emits text edits over a
//! parsed module. patches run as phase 2 of the sync — after reverse-transpile
//! but before the pep 695 `ruff-fix` — so they operate on the legacy
//! `TypeVar(...)` + `Generic[...]` form, where typevars appear as plain name
//! references in class bases and method signatures
//!
//! see `docs/basedpython/development/typeshed-patches.md` for the full design
//! and the ongoing typeshed sync workflow
