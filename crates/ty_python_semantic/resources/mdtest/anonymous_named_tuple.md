# basedpython: anonymous named tuple type expressions

In basedpython, `(name: T, name: T, ...)` is sugar for an inline `typing.NamedTuple` subclass. ty
synthesizes a `NamedTuple` class per unique shape (matching the transpiler) so attribute access on
the named fields resolves to the field's declared type. Identity is shape-based: two structurally
identical anonymous named tuples in the same file resolve to the same class.

## Type-expression position

### As a parameter annotation — named field access

```by
def f(x: (name: str, age: int)) -> None:
    reveal_type(x.name)  # revealed: str
    reveal_type(x.age)  # revealed: int
```

### As a return annotation — field access on the returned value

```by
def g() -> (name: str, age: int):
    return ("asdf", 1)

reveal_type(g().name)  # revealed: str
reveal_type(g().age)  # revealed: int
```

### As a variable annotation

```by
def f(s: str, n: int) -> None:
    a: (name: str, age: int) = (s, n)
    reveal_type(a.name)  # revealed: str
    reveal_type(a.age)  # revealed: int
```

### Single-field anonymous named tuple

```by
def h(x: (only: int)) -> None:
    reveal_type(x.only)  # revealed: int
```

### Mixed positional and named type fields

```by
def f(x: (int, name: str)) -> None:
    # Positional fields get synthetic names `arg0`, `arg1`, ...
    reveal_type(x.arg0)  # revealed: int
    reveal_type(x.name)  # revealed: str
```

## Construction syntax

### Value-form construction infers field types from the values

```by
a = (name="asdf", age=20)
reveal_type(a.name)  # revealed: "asdf"
reveal_type(a.age)  # revealed: 20
```

### Mixed positional and named value fields

```by
a = (1, name="a")
reveal_type(a.arg0)  # revealed: 1
reveal_type(a.name)  # revealed: "a"
```

## Assignability

### Plain tuple literal assigns to anonymous named tuple parameter

```by
def f(x: (name: str, age: int)) -> None: ...

f(("asdf", 1))
```

### Plain tuple literal returned from anonymous-named-tuple function

```by
def make() -> (name: str, age: int):
    return ("asdf", 1)
```

### Positional target field accepts named source field of compatible type

```by
a = (name = "asdf", age = 1)
b: (str, age: int) = a
```

### Named target field accepts positional source field of compatible type

```by
a = ("asdf", age = 1)
b: (name: str, age: int) = a
```

### Mismatched field name between named source and named target

```by
a = (other = "asdf", age = 1)
# error: [invalid-assignment]
b: (name: str, age: int) = a
```

### Mismatched field type

```by
a = (name = 1, age = 1)
# error: [invalid-assignment]
b: (name: str, age: int) = a
```

### Mismatched field count

```by
a = (name = "asdf",)
# error: [invalid-assignment]
b: (name: str, age: int) = a
```

### Diagnostic renders anonymous named tuple with surface syntax

```by
a = (name = 1, age = 1)
# error: [invalid-assignment] "Object of type `(name: 1, age: 1)` is not assignable to `(name: str, age: int)`"
b: (name: str, age: int) = a
```

## Structural identity

### Two identical shapes share a type

```by
a: (name: str, age: int) = ("a", 0)
b: (name: str, age: int) = ("b", 1)
b = a
```
