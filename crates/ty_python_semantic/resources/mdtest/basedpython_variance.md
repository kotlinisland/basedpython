# basedpython: use-site variance with `out` and `in`

basedpython supports use-site variance keywords on subscript elements:

- `Container[out T]` — covariant read-only view. Reading returns `T`; writing is rejected.
- `Container[in T]` — contravariant write-only projection. Accepts writes of `T`; reads project to
    `object`.
- `Container[in out T]` — invariant read-write view. Equivalent to plain `Container[T]` for
    read/write purposes.

The outer container's identity is preserved — `Container[out T]` is still a `Container`, with member
access projected according to the use-site variance, just like Kotlin's `Container<out T>` or Java's
`Container<? extends T>`.

## generic attribute write under `out`

```by
class Box[T]:
    value: T

def f(box: Box[out object]):
    # error: [invalid-assignment] "Cannot assign value of type `"asdf"` to attribute `value` on covariantly-projected object of type `Box[out object]`"
    box.value = "asdf"
```

## covariant `out`

```by
def f(data: list[out int]):
    reveal_type(data[0])  # revealed: int
    # error: [invalid-assignment] "Invalid subscript assignment with key of type `0` and value of type `1` on object of type `list[out int]`"
    data[0] = 1
```

The annotation also reveals the variance projection directly:

```by
def f(data: list[out int]):
    reveal_type(data)  # revealed: list[out int]
```

## contravariant `in`

`in T` allows writing `T` and projects reads through to `object`.

```by
def f(data: list[in int]):
    data[0] = 1  # ok: int accepted
    # error: [invalid-assignment]
    data[0] = "bad"
```

Reads return `object`, so a narrower-typed target rejects the read:

```by
def f(data: list[in int]):
    reveal_type(data[0])  # revealed: object
    b: object = data[0]  # ok
    # error: [invalid-assignment]
    a: int = data[0]
```

## invariant `in out`

`in out T` reads and writes as `T`, like the plain subscript form:

```by
def f(data: list[in out int]):
    reveal_type(data[0])  # revealed: int
    data[0] = 1  # ok
    # error: [invalid-assignment]
    data[0] = "bad"
```

## complex inner types

The inner type expression can be arbitrarily complex:

```by
def _(a: list[out int | str]):
    reveal_type(a[0])  # revealed: int | str
```

## subtyping under projection

Use-site projections promote an invariant generic to covariant or contravariant *at the call site*,
matching Kotlin's `Container<out T>` / `Container<in T>` rules.

`Container[out X]` is a supertype of `Container[Y]` whenever `Y <: X`:

```by
def widening(bools: list[bool]):
    # list[bool] <: list[out int] because bool <: int
    y: list[out int] = bools
```

`Container[in X]` is a supertype of `Container[Y]` whenever `Y :> X`:

```by
def widening_in(objs: list[object]):
    # list[object] <: list[in int] because int <: object
    y: list[in int] = objs
```

A projection is itself a wider set than the concrete form, so narrowing from a projection back to
the concrete form is rejected:

```by
def reject_narrowing(out_ints: list[out int]):
    # error: [invalid-assignment]
    y: list[int] = out_ints
```

`out` and `in` projections describe variance in opposite directions and have no subtyping relation:

```by
def reject_opposite(out_ints: list[out int]):
    # error: [invalid-assignment]
    y: list[in int] = out_ints
```

Two `out` projections relate by the inner type:

```by
def out_to_out(out_bools: list[out bool]):
    # list[out bool] <: list[out int] because bool <: int
    y: list[out int] = out_bools
```

## definition-site variance is independent

`out`/`in`/`in out` on type-parameter declarations is unrelated machinery that controls how each
instantiation specializes the underlying class:

```by
class Box[out T]:
    def get(self) -> T:
        raise NotImplementedError

def _(box: Box[int]):
    reveal_type(box.get())  # revealed: int
```

## `out` as an ordinary variable is not variance

Only `out` immediately followed by a *name* (`out T`) is a variance prefix — two adjacent names are
never valid Python. `out` followed by `[`, `(` or `.` is an ordinary subscript, call or attribute on
a variable named `out`, and must parse as plain Python. `out` is a common variable name; this
regressed on real code (`home-assistant` has `xs[out[0]]`):

```py
def f(xs: list[int], out: tuple[int, int]):
    reveal_type(xs[out[0]])  # revealed: int

def g(out: list[int]):
    reveal_type(out[0])  # revealed: int
```
