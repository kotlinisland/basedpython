# identity and isinstance

basedpython swaps the surface syntax for identity comparison and `isinstance`
checks: `===` is identity and `is` is an instance check

| basedpython  | Python output          |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `x === y`    | `x is y`               |
| `x !== y`    | `x is not y`           |
| `x is y`     | `isinstance(x, y)`     |
| `x is not y` | `not isinstance(x, y)` |

## why

`isinstance(x, T)` is the dominant runtime check; `is` for object identity is
rare outside of `is None`. basedpython promotes the common case to a keyword
and demotes identity to a triple-equals operator borrowed from JavaScript

## checking against `None`

`a is None` and `a is not None` stay as python identity checks. `a === None`
spells the same thing

## interaction with `==`

`==` is unchanged — it still calls `__eq__` exactly as in Python. only `is`
and `===` are remapped

## scope

the swap is purely syntactic and applies to every comparison in source. there
is no opt-out at the statement level — write `===` / `!==` whenever you mean
identity. ty understands both forms when type-checking `.by` files
