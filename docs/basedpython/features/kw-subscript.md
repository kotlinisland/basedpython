# keyword arguments in subscripts

basedpython allows keyword arguments inside subscriptions:

```by
result = x[a, z=1]
```

transpiles to:

```python
result = x.__getitem__(a, z=1)
```

python's subscript grammar doesn't accept keyword args (PEP 637 was rejected),
so basedpython lowers the call to the explicit `__getitem__` method. positional
and keyword args are forwarded in source order

## type subscripts

when the value is a known generic class, kw subscripts lower to a positional
type subscript instead of a `__getitem__` call. unbound typevars fall back to
their declared defaults:

```by
class A[T = int, R = str]: ...

a: A[T=bool]    # → a: A[bool, str]
b: A[R=int]     # → b: A[int, int]
c: A[R=int, T=bool]    # → c: A[bool, int]
```

ty's type-checking sees the reordered positional form, so type errors point at
the declared typevar order

## single-arg form

`A[T=int]` (no surrounding tuple) is also accepted for single- and multi-typevar
classes. For multi-typevar classes the same defaults rule applies; for
single-typevar classes the keyword name is dropped:

```by
class B[T]: ...
b: B[T=int]     # → b: B[int]
```

## scope

the rewrite fires for any subscription containing at least one keyword binding.
all-positional subscripts are untouched
