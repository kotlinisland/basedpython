# literal type promotion

basedpython promotes bare literal values to `typing.Literal` in type positions,
so the `Literal[...]` boilerplate is unnecessary:

```by
mode: 1 | 2 | 3
status: "ok" | "error"
flag: True
result: 1 | 2 | int
```

transpiles to:

```python
mode: Literal[1, 2, 3]
status: Literal["ok", "error"]
flag: Literal[True]
result: Literal[1, 2] | int
```

## promoted forms

the following literal forms are recognized in type contexts:

- integer literals: `1`, `-5`, `0xff`
- string literals: `"ok"`, `b"bytes"`
- booleans: `True`, `False`
- float and complex literals: `1.5`, `3.14j`

## scope

promotion fires only in syntactic type contexts: annotations, return types,
type aliases, and generic subscript slices whose target is a type. value
expressions are untouched. `Annotated[T, metadata]` does not treat its
metadata slice as a type context, so literal metadata is preserved

## polyfill

`Literal` is imported from `typing` exactly once per module that uses
promoted literal types
